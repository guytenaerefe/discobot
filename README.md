# Discobot

A [stackexchange](https://www.stackexchange.com/) bot for Discord API using [stackexchange](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stackexchange) and [`discord.js`](https://github.com/hydrabolt/discord.js/)

The environment variables are loaded for authenticating, using the [DotEnv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) package. 
Copy the `.env.example` to `.env` and enter your credentials. 

Todo:
* Get it to work first
* Refactor
* Write tests. Not TDD, because I have never written a serverside nodejs app before and have no idea how to approach it.
